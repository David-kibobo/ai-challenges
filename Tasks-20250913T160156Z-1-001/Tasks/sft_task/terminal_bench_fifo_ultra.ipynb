`.1`, `.2`, `.3`\n","\n","### Consumer (awk-only)\n","\n","* Reads directly from FIFO using `cat pipe/events.fifo | awk -f consumer.awk`\n","* Filters lines with `meta.admin = true`\n","* Tracks distinct sessions per user within a sliding 10s window\n","* Emits deduplicated alerts to `alerts.txt` using ISO UTC timestamps\n","\n","### Supervisor (`run.sh`)\n","\n","* Ensures idempotency using `flock`\n","* Starts consumer before producer\n","* Traps termination signals and ensures clean shutdown\n","* Collects runtime metrics and writes:\n","\n","  * `summary.json`\n","  *
