    "state_analysis": "The `producer.sh` script was successfully written with proper escaping and quoting. The script includes Unicode usernames, correct log rotation logic, and emits one line every 18\u201324 ms for ~31 seconds. The `chmod +x producer.sh` command was issued but appears to be stuck or not returning output. This is likely due to the terminal state or timing. We need to proceed to execute `run.sh` to start the full pipeline.",
    "explanation": "We will now attempt to run the supervisor script `run.sh` which should acquire the lock, start the consumer first, then the producer, run for ~31 seconds, and generate the required outputs. The consumer.awk will process the FIFO stream and generate alerts based on admin sessions within a 10-second sliding window. After completion, we expect `alerts.txt`, `summary.json`, and `timeline.json` to be populated with valid data meeting the task criteria.",
