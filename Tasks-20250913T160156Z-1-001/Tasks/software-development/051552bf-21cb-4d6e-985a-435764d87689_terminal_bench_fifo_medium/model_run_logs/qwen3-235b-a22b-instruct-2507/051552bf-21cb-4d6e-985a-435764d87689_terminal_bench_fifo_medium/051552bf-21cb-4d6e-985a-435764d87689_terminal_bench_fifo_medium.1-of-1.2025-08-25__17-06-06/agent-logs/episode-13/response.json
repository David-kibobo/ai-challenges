    "state_analysis": "The producer is streaming data into the FIFO, and the consumer.awk has likely encountered a broken pipe error after the consumer process terminated or the FIFO was closed unexpectedly. The stream shows Unicode usernames (e.g., \"\u8d75\u94b1\u5b59\", \"\u5c71\u7530\u592a\u90ce\") and some malformed lines (missing closing brace). The producer is active, but the consumer may have crashed or exited early, preventing alert generation. The run.sh script is still running but may not complete as expected.",
    "explanation": "The broken pipe error indicates the consumer (awk) stopped reading, but the producer continued writing. This could be due to awk crashing on malformed input or the pipeline not being properly maintained. We must ensure the consumer.awk is robust to malformed JSON and that the pipeline stays open. We will now stop the current execution, verify consumer.awk handles invalid lines gracefully, and adjust the producer to avoid overwhelming the consumer. Then we'll restart with better error resilience.",
