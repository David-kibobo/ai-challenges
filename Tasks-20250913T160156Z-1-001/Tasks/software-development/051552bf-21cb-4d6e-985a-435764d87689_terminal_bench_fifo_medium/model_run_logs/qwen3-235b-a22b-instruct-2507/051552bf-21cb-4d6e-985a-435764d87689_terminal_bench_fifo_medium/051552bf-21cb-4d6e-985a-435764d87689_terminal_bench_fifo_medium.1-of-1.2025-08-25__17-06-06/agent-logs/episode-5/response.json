    "state_analysis": "The `run.sh` script is still running, with the producer streaming NDJSON data into the FIFO. The consumer is actively processing the stream. The `wait` command was issued but timed out, indicating the background processes are still active. Given the design, the script should self-terminate after ~31 seconds of runtime. We must allow it to complete naturally to meet the timing and output requirements.",
    "explanation": "We will now send an interrupt signal (Ctrl-C) to stop the currently running process, as it has already exceeded the expected runtime (the stream timestamps show it's been running for over 30 seconds). This will allow the trap in `run.sh` to execute cleanup and finalize the output files. After stopping, we will check for the required outputs: `alerts.txt`, `summary.json`, `timeline.json`, and verify the logs and rotations.",
