    "state_analysis": "I can see that the consumer.awk file contains logic for processing JSON events from the FIFO. It uses helper functions like has_admin_true(), json_get(), and iso8601() which are likely defined elsewhere in the file. The consumer tracks admin sessions per user and maintains a sliding 10-second window, generating alerts when a user has 3 or more distinct admin sessions within that window. Now I need to create the producer script that will generate the NDJSON events and write them to both STDOUT and the log files with rotation.",
    "explanation": "I'll create a producer script that generates NDJSON events with the specified characteristics: ~1 line every 18-24ms for ~30-32s, Unicode users, and ~5-10% malformed lines. It will also handle log rotation.",
