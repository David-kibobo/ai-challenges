    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still receiving live NDJSON output from the producer, indicating that the pipeline is ongoing. The `ls -l` command timed out, suggesting that the files `alerts.txt`, `summary.json`, and `timeline.json` may not yet exist or are not accessible. This implies that the run.sh script has not completed successfully. However, the continuous stream of events confirms that the producer is active and emitting data at the expected rate (~18\u201324ms per line). The consumer (awk) should be processing these in real-time via the FIFO, but it appears to be stuck or not writing alerts to `alerts.txt`. Given that we're past the ~31-second window, and no 'DONE' message is printed, the task has not completed.",
    "explanation": "We will forcibly terminate the current run by sending Ctrl-C again, then re-run the script with a fresh start. Since the producer is already emitting lines, we expect the consumer to eventually generate alerts if the logic is correct. We'll wait for completion or timeout after 35 seconds to allow full execution. If no 'DONE' appears, we\u2019ll assume the script failed due to a deadlock in the awk consumer or FIFO handling.",
