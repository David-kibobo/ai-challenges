Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFor each response:\n1. Analyze the current state based on any terminal output provided\n2. Determine the next set of commands needed to make progress\n3. Decide if you need to see the output of these commands before proceeding\n\nInstruction:\nYou are inside a Linux container at /app. Build a **two-process pipeline** with a **single FIFO** and a **pure-awk consumer** that performs stateful streaming analysis, with strict, real-world constraints.\n\n## Topology\n- Create `pipe/events.fifo` (a named pipe).\n- **Producer**: write NDJSON lines to **STDOUT** and append the same lines to `logs/events.log` with **size-based rotation** (no timestamps): `.1`, `.2`, `.3`.\n  - Emit ~**1 line every 40\u201370 ms** for ~**30 s** total.\n  - Include **Unicode** users and inject **~5\u201310% malformed** lines.\n  - Example good line:\n    `{\"ts\": 1720000000123, \"session\": \"abc123\", \"user\": \"\u8d75\u94b1\u5b59\", \"meta\": {\"admin\": true}}`\n\n- **Consumer (awk-only)** must read **directly from the FIFO**, not from files:\n    ```bash\n    cat pipe/events.fifo | awk -f consumer.awk\n    ```\n  Forbidden: `jq`, `python`, `perl`, `node`, `ruby`, `tail`, reading `logs/` inside consumer, and **no `system()`** calls inside awk.\n\n  Logic:\n  - Join and track **distinct admin sessions per user** (where `meta.admin=true` on the JSON).\n  - Maintain a **sliding 10 s window** with **eviction** (drop old sessions continuously, not a fixed counter).\n  - When a user reaches **\u22653 distinct admin sessions within the last 10 s**, append ONE **deduped** alert line to `alerts.txt`:\n    `ALERT <USER> <COUNT> admin-sessions in 10s at <ISO8601>`\n    Use awk `strftime()` (no shelling-out for time).\n\n## Supervisor (`run.sh`)\n- `flock run.lock` for idempotency.\n- Ensure FIFO exists before starting processes.\n- Start **consumer first** (bg), then **producer** (bg). Trap INT/TERM and clean up.\n- Let it run ~**32 s**, then stop and write:\n  - `summary.json`: `{ producer_lines_total, alerts, rotations_min, parallel: true }`\n  - `timeline.json`: `{ consumer_start_ms, producer_start_ms, consumer_end_ms, producer_end_ms }`\n- Print **DONE** on success.\n\n## Hard constraints checked by tests (natural failure points)\n- Consumer uses **only** the FIFO stream + awk, with the exact pipeline pattern (no file reads, no `system()`).\n- **Unicode** & malformed lines must not crash the pipeline.\n- **Rotations:** `events.log`, `.1`, `.2`, `.3` exist and are non-trivial sizes.\n- **Volume:** `producer_lines_total \u2265 1100`.\n- **Timeline:** consumer starts **before** producer; **overlap \u2265 12 s**.\n- **Alerts:** \u2265 **3 alerts** for \u2265 **2 distinct users**, with **\u22651 non-ASCII** username; alerts must be **truthy** (re-derivable from logs given the 10 s window and admin sessions).\n\n\nYour response must be a JSON object that matches this schema:\n\n{\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"Command\": {\n      \"additionalProperties\": false,\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"keystrokes\": {\n          \"description\": \"Keystrokes to execute in the terminal.

In these cases, you should not wait for the output of the command. Instead, you should send the keystrokes to the terminal as if you were typing them.\n\nThe current terminal state is:\nroot@71d33cf7f63a:/app#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The task requires setting up a two-process pipeline with a FIFO, a producer that emits NDJSON lines with Unicode and malformed entries, and an awk-only consumer that performs stateful streaming analysis. The supervisor script 'run.sh' must be created and executed to orchestrate the pipeline with proper cleanup and reporting.\\\",\\n  \\\"explanation\\\": \\\"First, create the necessary directory structure and files: a FIFO named 'pipe/events.fifo', a consumer.awk script for stateful processing of admin sessions with a sliding 10-second window, and a run.sh supervisor script with flock protection, proper process ordering, and cleanup logic. Then, write the producer logic (in bash) to generate NDJSON lines at ~40\\u201370ms intervals for ~30 seconds, including Unicode users and 5\\u201310% malformed lines. Finally, execute the run.sh script to start the pipeline and verify outputs like alerts.txt, logs, summary.json, and timeline.json meet all constraints.\\\",\\n  \\\"commands\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"mkdir -p pipe logs\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"is_blocking\\\": true,\\n      \\\"timeout_sec\\\": 5\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"mkfifo pipe/events.fifo\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"is_blocking\\\": true,\\n      \\\"timeout_sec\\\": 5\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"cat > consumer.awk << 'EOF'\\\\nBEGIN { \\\\n    window_size = 10000 # 10 seconds in ms\\\\n    FS = \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\"\\\\n}\\\\n{ \\\\n    if (NF == 0) next\\\\n    gsub(/^[[:space:]]+|[[:space:]]+$/, \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\", $0)\\\\n    if (!match($0, /^\\\\\\\\{.*\\\\\\\\}$/)) continue\\\\n    if (!match($0, /\\\\\\\"meta\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\{.*\\\\\\\"admin\\\\\\\":true/)) continue\\\\n    \\\\n    # Extract user\\\\n    match($0, /\\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\s*\\\\\\\"([^\\\\\\\"]*)\\\\\\\",/, usr)\\\\n    user = usr[1]\\\\n    \\\\n    # Extract timestamp\\\\n    match($0, /\\\\\\\"ts\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\s*(\\\\\\\\d+)/, ts)\\\\n    ts_ms = ts[1] + 0\\\\n    \\\\n    # Skip if not valid timestamp\\\\n    if (ts_ms <= 0) continue\\\\n    \\\\n    # Add session ID: user + session\\\\n    match($0, /\\\\\\\"session\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\s*\\\\\\\"([^\\\\\\\"]*)\\\\\\\",/, sess)\\\\n    session_id = user \\\\\\\"_\\\\\\\" sess[1]\\\\n    \\\\n    # Track sessions per user\\\\n    if (!(user in user_sessions)) {\\\\n        user_sessions[user] = \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\n        user_count[user] = 0\\\\n    }\\\\n    \\\\n    # Add session to set\\\\n    if (user_sessions[user] !~ (\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\b\\\\\\\" session_id \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\b\\\\\\\")) {\\\\n        user_sessions[user] = user_sessions[user] session_id \\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"\\\\n        user_count[user] += 1\\\\n    }\\\\n    \\\\n    # Update timestamp\\\\n    last_seen[user] = ts_ms\\\\n    \\\\n    # Evict old sessions (older than 10s)\\\\n    now = ts_ms\\\\n    for (u in user_sessions) {\\\\n        if (now - last_seen[u] > window_size) {\\\\n            delete user_sessions[u]\\\\n            delete user_count[u]\\\\n            delete last_seen[u]\\\\n        }\\\\n    }\\\\n    \\\\n    # Check if user has \\u22653 distinct admin sessions in last 10s\\\\n    if (user_count[user] >= 3) {\\\\n        # Dedup alert only once per user within window\\\\n        if (!alerted[user]) {\\\\n            alerted[user] = 1\\\\n            printf \\\\\\\"ALERT %s %d admin-sessions in 10s at %s\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\", user, user_count[user], strftime(\\\\\\\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\\\\\\\", ts_ms/1000) > \\\\\\\"alerts.txt\\\\\\\"\\\\n        }\\\\n    }\\\\n}\\\\nEND {\\\\n    close(\\\\\\\"alerts.txt\\\\\\\")\\\\n}\\\\nEOF\\\\n\\\",\\n      \\\"is_blocking\\\": true,\\n      \\\"timeout_sec\\\": 10\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"keystrokes\\\": \\\"cat > run.sh << 'EOF'\\\\n#!/bin/bash\\\\nset -euo pipefail\\\\n\\\\nLOCK_FILE=\\\\\\\"run.lock\\\\\\\"\\\\nFIFO=\\\\\\\"pipe/events.fifo\\\\\\\"\\\\nLOG_FILE=\\\\\\\"logs/events.log\\\\\\\"\\\\nMAX_ROTATIONS=3\\\\n\\\\n# Ensure FIFO exists\\\\nif [[ ! -p \\\\\\\"$FIFO\\\\\\\" ]];
