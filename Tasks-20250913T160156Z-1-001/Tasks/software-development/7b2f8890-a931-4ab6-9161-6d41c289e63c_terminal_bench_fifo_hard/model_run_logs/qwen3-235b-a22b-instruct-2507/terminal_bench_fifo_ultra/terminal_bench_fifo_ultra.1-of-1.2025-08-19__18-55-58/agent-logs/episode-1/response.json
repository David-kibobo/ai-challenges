    "explanation": "We will create the named pipe events.fifo in the pipe directory, then implement the consumer.awk script that can parse NDJSON lines, extract user and admin session information, maintain a sliding 10-second window of sessions, and generate alerts when a user has 3 or more distinct admin sessions within that window. The awk script will use associative arrays to track state and strftime for ISO8601 timestamps.",
