    "state_analysis": "The run.sh script creation appears to have timed out, but this is likely due to the tmux wait mechanism rather than a failure in the command execution. The script has probably been written successfully. We now need to execute the supervisor script to run the full pipeline and verify that all components work together correctly, producing the required output and meeting all constraints.",
    "explanation": "We will now execute the run.sh supervisor script which should start the consumer, then the producer, run for approximately 32 seconds, and generate the required output files (summary.json, timeline.json) and print 'DONE' on success. This will test the complete pipeline including the FIFO, producer with log rotation, consumer with sliding window analysis, and proper process coordination.",
