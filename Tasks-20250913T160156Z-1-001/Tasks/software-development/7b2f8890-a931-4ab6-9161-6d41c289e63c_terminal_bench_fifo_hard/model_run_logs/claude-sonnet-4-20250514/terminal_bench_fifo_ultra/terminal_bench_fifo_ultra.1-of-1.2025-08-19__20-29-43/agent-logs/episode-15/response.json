    "state_analysis": "The pipeline has good results: 4 rotations (rotations_min=3), timeline shows proper overlap (consumer started at 858924, producer at 859429, both ended around 891440 - overlap of ~32s). However, there are issues: 1) No alerts generated (need \u22653 alerts for \u22652 distinct users), 2) Total lines is only 626 (need \u22651100), 3) There's a discrepancy between producer output (1037 lines) and actual log files (626 lines total). The consumer may not be processing the FIFO correctly or there's a pipeline issue.",
    "explanation": "Check a sample of the log data to understand the format and debug why no alerts are being generated. Then fix the issue - likely the consumer is not properly reading from the FIFO or the alert logic needs adjustment.",
