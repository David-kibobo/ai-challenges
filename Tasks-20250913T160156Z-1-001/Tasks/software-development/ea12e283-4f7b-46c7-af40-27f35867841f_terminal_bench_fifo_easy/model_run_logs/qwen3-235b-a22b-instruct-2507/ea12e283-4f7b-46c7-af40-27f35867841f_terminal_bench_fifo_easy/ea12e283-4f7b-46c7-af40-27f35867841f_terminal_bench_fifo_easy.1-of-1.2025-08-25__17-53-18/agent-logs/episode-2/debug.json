Determine the next set of commands needed to make progress\n3. Decide if you need to see the output of these commands before proceeding\n\nInstruction:\nYou are inside a Linux container at /app. Your goal is to run a **two-process pipeline** using a **single FIFO** and a **pure-awk consumer** to perform basic streaming log analysis.\n\n## What is already provided for you\nThe following files are already present in the container at the root `/app`:\n- `consumer.awk`: parses NDJSON lines and writes alerts to `alerts.txt`\n- `producer.py`: emits NDJSON log lines to STDOUT and appends them to rotating files\n- `run.sh`: the supervisor script that orchestrates everything\n- `write_json.py`: writes `summary.json` and `timeline.json` based on run metrics\n\n## What you need to do\n1. Create the `pipe/` and `logs/` directories if they don\u2019t exist.\n2. Create a FIFO file at `pipe/events.fifo` using `mkfifo`.\n3. Run the supervisor script:\n   ```bash\n   ./run.sh\n   ```\n\n## What the pipeline does (already implemented)\n- The **producer** writes ~1 NDJSON line every 25\u201330 ms for ~25 seconds, logs them to `logs/events.log`, and handles log rotation (`.1`, `.2`, `.3`).\n- The **consumer** reads directly from the FIFO and uses `awk` to detect when a user accumulates \u22653 admin sessions in a 10s window.

You will be given a task instruction and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFor each response:\n1. Analyze the current state based on any terminal output provided\n2. Determine the next set of commands needed to make progress\n3. Decide if you need to see the output of these commands before proceeding\n\nInstruction:\nYou are inside a Linux container at /app. Your goal is to run a **two-process pipeline** using a **single FIFO** and a **pure-awk consumer** to perform basic streaming log analysis.\n\n## What is already provided for you\nThe following files are already present in the container at the root `/app`:\n- `consumer.awk`: parses NDJSON lines and writes alerts to `alerts.txt`\n- `producer.py`: emits NDJSON log lines to STDOUT and appends them to rotating files\n- `run.sh`: the supervisor script that orchestrates everything\n- `write_json.py`: writes `summary.json` and `timeline.json` based on run metrics\n\n## What you need to do\n1. Create the `pipe/` and `logs/` directories if they don\u2019t exist.\n2. Create a FIFO file at `pipe/events.fifo` using `mkfifo`.\n3. Run the supervisor script:\n   ```bash\n   ./run.sh\n   ```\n\n## What the pipeline does (already implemented)\n- The **producer** writes ~1 NDJSON line every 25\u201330 ms for ~25 seconds, logs them to `logs/events.log`, and handles log rotation (`.1`, `.2`, `.3`).\n- The **consumer** reads directly from the FIFO and uses `awk` to detect when a user accumulates \u22653 admin sessions in a 10s window. It emits **deduplicated** alerts to `alerts.txt` using `strftime()`.\n\n## Log line example (valid line)\n\n`{\"ts\": 1720000000123, \"session\": \"abc123\", \"user\": \"\u8d75\u94b1\u5b59\", \"meta\": {\"admin\": true}}`\n\n\n## Supervisor behavior\n- Uses `flock run.lock` to ensure idempotency (only one instance runs)\n- Starts consumer first, then producer\n- Cleans up properly on termination\n- Runs for ~26s before terminating both processes\n- Writes:\n  - `summary.json`: `{ producer_lines_total, alerts, rotations_min, parallel: true }`\n  - `timeline.json`: `{ consumer_start_ms, producer_start_ms, consumer_end_ms, producer_end_ms }`\n- Prints `DONE` on success\n\n## Easy-level constraints (checked by tests)\n- **All required files are already available**\n- Consumer uses **only FIFO + awk** (no file reads, no system())\n- **Malformed + Unicode** lines must not crash\n- **Volume**: `producer_lines_total \u2265 600`\n- **Rotations**: at least `.1` and `.2` exist; one file \u2265 1024 bytes\n- **Timeline**: consumer starts before producer; overlap \u2265 6s\n- **Alerts**: \u22652 alerts for \u22651 distinct user (at least one with non-ASCII); spacing between alerts \u22652.0s\n\n\nYour response must be a JSON object that matches this schema:\n\n{\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"Command\": {\n      \"additionalProperties\": false,\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"keystrokes\": {\n          \"description\": \"Keystrokes to execute in the terminal.

Use tmux keystrokes like `C-x` or `Escape` to interactively navigate the terminal.
