It uses `flock` for idempotency, starts the consumer (pure awk reading from FIFO), then the producer (emits NDJSON every 25\u201330ms), manages log rotation, and generates the required output files (`alerts.txt`, `summary.json`, `timeline.json`). It runs for ~26 seconds and prints `DONE` upon success.",
