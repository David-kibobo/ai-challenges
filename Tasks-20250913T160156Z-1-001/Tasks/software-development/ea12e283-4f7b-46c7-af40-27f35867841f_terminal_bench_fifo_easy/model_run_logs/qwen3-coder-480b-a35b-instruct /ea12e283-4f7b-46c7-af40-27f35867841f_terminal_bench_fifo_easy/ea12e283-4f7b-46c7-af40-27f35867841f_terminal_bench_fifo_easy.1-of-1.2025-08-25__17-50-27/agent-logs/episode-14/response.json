The task requirements have been met: 1) Created pipe/ and logs/ directories, 2) Created FIFO at pipe/events.fifo, 3) Ran the supervisor script successfully. The output shows: - Producer lines: 792 (\u2265 600) - Alerts generated: 7 for 7 distinct users (including non-ASCII names) - Rotations: 3 (\u2265 2) with files > 1024 bytes - Timeline shows consumer started before producer - Alerts are properly spaced in time",
