    "state_analysis": "The producer is still running and emitting NDJSON lines to stdout (and logging), but the consumer has not yet printed 'DONE'. The output shows a continuous stream of events, including Unicode users ('\u8d75\u94b1\u5b59') and malformed lines. The consumer should be processing these in real-time via `awk -f consumer.awk` reading from the FIFO. However, the pipeline may have stalled or the consumer is not fully consuming due to buffering or awk state issues. We need to check if the consumer process is alive and whether alerts are being generated.",
    "explanation": "We will inspect the current processes to verify that both the consumer and producer are active. If they are, we'll wait for completion. If not, we may need to force-terminate and re-run. Since the producer is emitting lines at ~18\u201324ms intervals, and we're past ~30 seconds, we expect the run.sh script to have completed by now. The absence of 'DONE' suggests a hang. We\u2019ll send Ctrl-C to interrupt the script, then re-execute it with a fresh start to ensure cleanup and restart.",
