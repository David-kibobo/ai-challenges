    "state_analysis": "The producer is still emitting events, but the consumer has not completed. The run.sh script appears to be stuck or not terminating properly. After sending Ctrl-C and re-running the script, it may have started again, but we need to verify if the pipeline is now progressing correctly. The absence of 'DONE' output indicates the script hasn't finished. We suspect a race condition or deadlock in the awk consumer due to state handling or FIFO buffering.",
    "explanation": "We will check for the existence of the required output files: alerts.txt, summary.json, timeline.json. If they exist, we can validate the task criteria. If not, we'll attempt to interrupt and restart the process with a more robust signal handling. Since the producer emits ~900 lines over ~31 seconds, and we're past that time, the script should have terminated. We'll inspect the files directly to determine success.",
