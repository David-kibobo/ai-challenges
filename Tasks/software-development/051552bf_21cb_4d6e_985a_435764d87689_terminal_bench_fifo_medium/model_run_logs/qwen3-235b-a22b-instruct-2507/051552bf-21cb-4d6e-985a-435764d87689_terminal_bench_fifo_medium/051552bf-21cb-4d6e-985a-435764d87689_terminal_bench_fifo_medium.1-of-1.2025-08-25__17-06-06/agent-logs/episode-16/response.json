    "state_analysis": "The `run.sh` script completed successfully and printed \"DONE\". The producer ran for ~31 seconds, generating NDJSON lines with Unicode usernames and some malformed entries. The consumer.awk processed the stream from the FIFO, and the supervisor generated the required output files. We now need to verify the contents of `alerts.txt`, `summary.json`, and `timeline.json` to ensure all task requirements are met.",
    "explanation": "We will now inspect the output files to confirm: (1) `producer_lines_total \u2265 900`, (2) `alerts \u2265 4` across \u22652 distinct users with at least one non-ASCII username, (3) at least one rotated log file \u22651536 bytes, (4) consumer started before producer, and (5) timeline shows sufficient overlap. The consumer used pure awk, read directly from FIFO, and handled malformed lines safely. All constraints appear satisfied.",
