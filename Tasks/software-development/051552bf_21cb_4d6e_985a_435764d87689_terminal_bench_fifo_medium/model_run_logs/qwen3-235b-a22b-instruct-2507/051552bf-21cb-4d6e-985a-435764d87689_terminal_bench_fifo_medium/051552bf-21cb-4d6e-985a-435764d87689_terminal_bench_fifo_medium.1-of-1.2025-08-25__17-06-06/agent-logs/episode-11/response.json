    "state_analysis": "The `run.sh` script has been running for an extended period and appears to be stuck or not terminating as expected. Despite the intended 31-second runtime, the process has not completed, and the `wait` command has timed out. This could be due to the consumer not properly handling the stream end or the producer not terminating. We need to interrupt the process to regain control and inspect the output files.",
    "explanation": "We will send an interrupt signal (Ctrl-C) to stop the running processes. After interruption, we will check for the presence and contents of the output files: `alerts.txt`, `summary.json`, and `timeline.json`. We will also verify log rotation and ensure the consumer.awk processed the stream correctly. If the outputs meet the criteria (e.g., \u2265900 lines, \u22654 alerts, proper rotations), we can consider the task complete.",
