    "state_analysis": "The `run.sh` script is currently executing and has likely started both the consumer and producer processes. The producer is streaming NDJSON lines into the FIFO at the required rate, and the consumer is processing them via `awk`. The script is designed to run for ~31 seconds, after which it will generate the required output files: `alerts.txt`, `summary.json`, and `timeline.json`. We must allow it to complete naturally to meet the timing and data volume requirements.",
    "explanation": "We will now wait for the `run.sh` script to complete its execution. Once finished, it will output 'DONE' and generate the necessary files. After completion, we will verify the contents of `summary.json` and `timeline.json` to ensure all criteria are met, including producer line count \u2265900, \u22654 alerts, proper rotations, and correct timing (consumer starts before producer, overlap \u22659s).",
