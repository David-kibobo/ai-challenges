    "state_analysis": "The `run.sh` script is currently executing, and the producer is streaming NDJSON lines into the FIFO, as evidenced by the ongoing output from the consumer pipeline. The stream includes Unicode usernames (e.g., \"\u8d75\u94b1\u5b59\", \"\u5c71\u7530\u592a\u90ce\") and some malformed lines (e.g., missing closing brace). The consumer.awk is processing the stream in real time. The process has not yet completed, so outputs like `alerts.txt`, `summary.json`, and `timeline.json` are likely not finalized.",
    "explanation": "We must allow the script to continue running until it naturally terminates after ~31 seconds. The supervisor script includes a `sleep 31` to ensure duration, after which it will clean up, generate the required output files, and print \"DONE\". Interrupting now would invalidate the results. We will wait for the process to complete and then verify the outputs.",
