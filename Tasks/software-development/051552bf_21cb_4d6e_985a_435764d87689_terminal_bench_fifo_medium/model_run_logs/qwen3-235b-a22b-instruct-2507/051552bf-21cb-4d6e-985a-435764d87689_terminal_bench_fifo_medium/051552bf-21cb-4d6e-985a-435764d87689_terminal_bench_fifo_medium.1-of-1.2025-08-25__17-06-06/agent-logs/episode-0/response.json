    "state_analysis": "The current working directory is /app inside a Linux container. No files are visible yet, and we need to set up the entire pipeline as per the specification. We must create directories, files, and implement both producer and consumer logic along with the supervisor script. The consumer.awk script is assumed to be present in the task directory as per instructions.",
    "explanation": "We will first create necessary directories (pipe, logs), then ensure the FIFO is created. We'll write the producer logic that emits NDJSON lines with Unicode and malformed entries at the required rate, with log rotation. Then we'll verify the presence of consumer.awk and write the supervisor script run.sh that orchestrates the pipeline using flock, starts consumer before producer, runs for ~31 seconds, and generates the required summary and timeline. Finally, we'll execute the supervisor and verify output.",
