    "explanation": "First, create the necessary 'pipe/' and 'logs/' directories if they don't exist. Then, create a named pipe (FIFO) at 'pipe/events.fifo' using mkfifo. Finally, execute the supervisor script './run.sh' to start the two-process pipeline with the pure-awk consumer reading from the FIFO and the producer writing to it. The script will handle the rest including logging, alert generation, and cleanup.",
