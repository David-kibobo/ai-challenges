    "state_analysis": "The `run.sh` script is still running and has been hanging for over 30 seconds. The warning about the regexp escape sequence `\"` persists, but it appears to be a false alarm or an artifact of how awk parses the script in this environment. The pipeline is likely waiting for the producer to start writing to the FIFO, but no progress is visible. The terminal is not responding to `C-c` because it's being interpreted literally. We need to interrupt the process properly using `kill` or by sending a signal via `tmux`.",
    "explanation": "Since the command is stuck and unresponsive, we will terminate it using `kill` with the process ID. First, we'll identify the running processes related to `run.sh`, then kill them. After cleanup, we\u2019ll re-run the script to restart the pipeline. This ensures a fresh execution without lingering processes blocking the FIFO.",
