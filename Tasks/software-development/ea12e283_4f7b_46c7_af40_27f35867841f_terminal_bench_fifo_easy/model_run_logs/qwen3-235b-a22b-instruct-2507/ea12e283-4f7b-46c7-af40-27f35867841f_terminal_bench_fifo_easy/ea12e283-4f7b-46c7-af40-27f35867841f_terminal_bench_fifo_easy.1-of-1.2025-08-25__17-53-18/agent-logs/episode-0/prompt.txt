You are an AI assistant tasked with solving command-line tasks in a Linux environment. You will be given a task instruction and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.

For each response:
1. Analyze the current state based on any terminal output provided
2. Determine the next set of commands needed to make progress
3. Decide if you need to see the output of these commands before proceeding

Instruction:
You are inside a Linux container at /app. Your goal is to run a **two-process pipeline** using a **single FIFO** and a **pure-awk consumer** to perform basic streaming log analysis.

## What is already provided for you
The following files are already present in the container at the root `/app`:
- `consumer.awk`: parses NDJSON lines and writes alerts to `alerts.txt`
- `producer.py`: emits NDJSON log lines to STDOUT and appends them to rotating files
- `run.sh`: the supervisor script that orchestrates everything
- `write_json.py`: writes `summary.json` and `timeline.json` based on run metrics

## What you need to do
1. Create the `pipe/` and `logs/` directories if they don’t exist.
2. Create a FIFO file at `pipe/events.fifo` using `mkfifo`.
3. Run the supervisor script:
   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```

## What the pipeline does (already implemented)
- The **producer** writes ~1 NDJSON line every 25–30 ms for ~25 seconds, logs them to `logs/events.log`, and handles log rotation (`.1`, `.2`, `.3`).
- The **consumer** reads directly from the FIFO and uses `awk` to detect when a user accumulates ≥3 admin sessions in a 10s window. It emits **deduplicated** alerts to `alerts.txt` using `strftime()`.

## Log line example (valid line)

`{"ts": 1720000000123, "session": "abc123", "user": "赵钱孙", "meta": {"admin": true}}`


## Supervisor behavior
- Uses `flock run.lock` to ensure idempotency (only one instance runs)
- Starts consumer first, then producer
- Cleans up properly on termination
- Runs for ~26s before terminating both processes
- Writes:
  - `summary.json`: `{ producer_lines_total, alerts, rotations_min, parallel: true }`
  - `timeline.json`: `{ consumer_start_ms, producer_start_ms, consumer_end_ms, producer_end_ms }`
- Prints `DONE` on success

## Easy-level constraints (checked by tests)
- **All required files are already available**
- Consumer uses **only FIFO + awk** (no file reads, no system())
- **Malformed + Unicode** lines must not crash
- **Volume**: `producer_lines_total ≥ 600`
- **Rotations**: at least `.1` and `.2` exist; one file ≥ 1024 bytes
- **Timeline**: consumer starts before producer; overlap ≥ 6s
- **Alerts**: ≥2 alerts for ≥1 distinct user (at least one with non-ASCII); spacing between alerts ≥2.0s

Don't include markdown formatting.

Note that you operate directly on the terminal from inside a tmux session. Use tmux keystrokes like `C-x` or `Escape` to interactively navigate the terminal. If you would like to execute a command that you have written you will need to append a newline character to the end of your command.

For example, if you write "ls -la" you will need to append a newline character to the end of your command like this: `ls -la\n`.

One thing to be very careful about is handling interactive sessions like less, vim, or git diff. In these cases, you should not wait for the output of the command. Instead, you should send the keystrokes to the terminal as if you were typing them.

The current terminal state is:
