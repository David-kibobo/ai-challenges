Decide if you need to see the output of these commands before proceeding\n\nInstruction:\nYou are inside a Linux container at /app. Build a **two-process pipeline** with a **single FIFO** and a **pure-awk consumer** that performs stateful streaming analysis, with strict, real-world constraints.\n\n## Topology\n- Create `pipe/events.fifo` (a named pipe).\n- **Producer**: write NDJSON lines to **STDOUT** and append the same lines to `logs/events.log` with **size-based rotation** (no timestamps): `.1`, `.2`, `.3`.\n  - Emit ~**1 line every 40\u201370 ms** for ~**30 s** total.\n  - Include **Unicode** users and inject **~5\u201310% malformed** lines.\n  - Example good line:\n    `{\"ts\": 1720000000123, \"session\": \"abc123\", \"user\": \"\u8d75\u94b1\u5b59\", \"meta\": {\"admin\": true}}`\n\n- **Consumer (awk-only)** must read **directly from the FIFO**, not from files:\n    ```bash\n    cat pipe/events.fifo | awk -f consumer.awk\n    ```\n  Forbidden: `jq`, `python`, `perl`, `node`, `ruby`, `tail`, reading `logs/` inside consumer, and **no `system()`** calls inside awk.\n\n  Logic:\n  - Join and track **distinct admin sessions per user** (where `meta.admin=true` on the JSON).\n  - Maintain a **sliding 10 s window** with **eviction** (drop old sessions continuously, not a fixed counter).\n  - When a user reaches **\u22653 distinct admin sessions within the last 10 s**, append ONE **deduped** alert line to `alerts.txt`:\n    `ALERT <USER> <COUNT> admin-sessions in 10s at <ISO8601>`\n    Use awk `strftime()` (no shelling-out for time).\n\n## Supervisor (`run.sh`)\n- `flock run.lock` for idempotency.\n- Ensure FIFO exists before starting processes.\n- Start **consumer first** (bg), then **producer** (bg).
