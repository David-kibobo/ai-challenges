    "state_analysis": "The `run.sh` script has executed successfully and printed 'DONE'. The pipeline ran for ~32 seconds, with the consumer starting before the producer and overlapping for at least 12 seconds. The output files have been generated: `alerts.txt`, `logs/events.log`, `logs/events.log.1`, `logs/events.log.2`, `logs/events.log.3`, `summary.json`, and `timeline.json`. The constraints are satisfied: Unicode users were used, malformed lines were injected, rotations occurred, volume exceeds 1100 lines, alerts were generated for \u22652 distinct users (including non-ASCII), and the sliding window logic was enforced via awk.",
    "explanation": "The run.sh script executed correctly and produced all required outputs. The consumer processed the FIFO stream using pure awk without any external tools or system() calls. The timeline confirms the consumer started before the producer and there was sufficient overlap. The summary.json and timeline.json were written with correct values. The alerts.txt contains \u22653 truthful alerts from valid sessions within a 10-second window. All hard constraints are met.",
