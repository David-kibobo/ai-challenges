    "state_analysis": "The current working directory is /app. No files have been created yet. The task requires creating a complex pipeline with a named pipe, a producer that generates NDJSON with specific constraints, a pure-awk consumer for stateful analysis, and a supervisor script. We are starting from scratch.",
    "explanation": "We will begin by creating the necessary directory structure, then implement the core components in the correct order: first the consumer.awk script (required before starting the pipeline), then the producer logic, followed by the supervisor script that coordinates everything with proper locking and timing. We'll ensure all constraints are met including Unicode support, error injection, log rotation, and sliding window tracking in awk.",
