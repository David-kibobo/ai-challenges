Decide if you need to see the output of these commands before proceeding\n\nInstruction:\nYou are inside a Linux container at /app. Build a **two-process pipeline** with a **single FIFO** and a **pure-awk consumer** that performs stateful streaming analysis, with strict, real-world constraints.\n\n## Topology\n- Create `pipe/events.fifo` (a named pipe).\n- **Producer**: write NDJSON lines to **STDOUT** and append the same lines to `logs/events.log` with **size-based rotation** (no timestamps): `.1`, `.2`, `.3`.\n  - Emit ~**1 line every 40\u201370 ms** for ~**30 s** total.\n  - Include **Unicode** users and inject **~5\u201310% malformed** lines.\n  - Example good line:\n    `{\"ts\": 1720000000123, \"session\": \"abc123\", \"user\": \"\u8d75\u94b1\u5b59\", \"meta\": {\"admin\": true}}`\n\n- **Consumer (awk-only)** must read **directly from the FIFO**, not from files:\n    ```bash\n    cat pipe/events.fifo | awk -f consumer.awk\n    ```\n  Forbidden: `jq`, `python`, `perl`, `node`, `ruby`, `tail`, reading `logs/` inside consumer, and **no `system()`** calls inside awk.\n\n  Logic:\n  - Join and track **distinct admin sessions per user** (where `meta.admin=true` on the JSON).\n  - Maintain a **sliding 10 s window** with **eviction** (drop old sessions continuously, not a fixed counter).\n  - When a user reaches **\u22653 distinct admin sessions within the last 10 s**, append ONE **deduped** alert line to `alerts.txt`:\n    `ALERT <USER> <COUNT> admin-sessions in 10s at <ISO8601>`\n    Use awk `strftime()` (no shelling-out for time).\n\n## Supervisor (`run.sh`)\n- `flock run.lock` for idempotency.\n- Ensure FIFO exists before starting processes.\n- Start **consumer first** (bg), then **producer** (bg). Trap INT/TERM and clean up.\n- Let it run ~**32 s**, then stop and write:\n  - `summary.json`: `{ producer_lines_total, alerts, rotations_min, parallel: true }`\n  - `timeline.json`: `{ consumer_start_ms, producer_start_ms, consumer_end_ms, producer_end_ms }`\n- Print **DONE** on success.\n\n## Hard constraints checked by tests (natural failure points)\n- Consumer uses **only** the FIFO stream + awk, with the exact pipeline pattern (no file reads, no `system()`).\n- **Unicode** & malformed lines must not crash the pipeline.\n- **Rotations:** `events.log`, `.1`, `.2`, `.3` exist and are non-trivial sizes.\n- **Volume:** `producer_lines_total \u2265 1100`.\n- **Timeline:** consumer starts **before** producer; **overlap \u2265 12 s**.\n- **Alerts:** \u2265 **3 alerts** for \u2265 **2 distinct users**, with **\u22651 non-ASCII** username; alerts must be **truthy** (re-derivable from logs given the 10 s window and admin sessions).\n\n\nYour response must be a JSON object that matches this schema:\n\n{\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"Command\": {\n      \"additionalProperties\": false,\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"keystrokes\": {\n          \"description\": \"Keystrokes to execute in the terminal.
